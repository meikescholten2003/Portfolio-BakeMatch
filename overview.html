                            <p>The core feature of BakeMatch allows users to select ingredients they have at home. The system instantly filters and displays recipes that can be made with those exact ingredients. Users can also see recipes with just one missing ingredient, encouraging flexibility and creativity.</p>
                            <p>The ingredient selection is intuitive and visual, making it easy for users to quickly input what they have without typing long lists. This reverses the traditional recipe search and puts users' real kitchen situations first.</p>
