                <p class="section-intro">
                    BakeMatch is an interactive website that reverses the traditional recipe search process. Instead of finding a recipe and then buying ingredients, users simply enter what they have at home and instantly discover which dishes they can make. The platform combines functionality, simplicity, and creativity to make cooking fun and inspiring.

                <h2 class="section-title">The Problem It Solves</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">
                    Many people, especially students and young professionals, often have ingredients at home but don't know what to make with them. Traditional recipe platforms focus on ideal recipes instead of real kitchens, leading to frustration when users realize they're missing half the ingredients.
                </p>
                <p class="section-intro">
                    BakeMatch reverses this logic by starting with what users already have at home. It makes cooking more accessible while helping reduce food waste and encouraging creativity in the kitchen. The platform targets students, young professionals, and beginner cooks who want quick meal inspiration without complex steps or overwhelming interfaces.
